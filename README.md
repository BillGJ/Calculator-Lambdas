The purpose is to demonstrate a use case of *Lambdas* are used for in this scenario

To run this code using the command line, do:

1. `javac -cp . Calculate.java` to compile
2. And then run one of those codes below for operations:
   1. `java -cp . Calculate 1 + 2` for performing an example of addition
   2. `java -cp . Calculate 1 - 2` for performing an example of subtraction
   3. `java -cp . Calculate 1 * 2` for performing an example of multiplication
   4. `java -cp . Calculate 2 / 1` for performing an example of division
